<h2>Mario-Zork-Style</h2><br>
================
The mario text advanture game written in Ruby. I wrote this tiny Ruby game as my practice on <a href="http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/book/">Learn Ruby The Hard Way</a>.
The Game is not yet complete. However, it could benefit anybody who is also new to Ruby and wants to get his feet into some OOP practice. There is another great example which I referenced from, <a href="https://github.com/jwworth/twelve-labors">Twelve-labors</a> written by <a href="https://github.com/jwworth">jwworth</a>. <br>
Please feel free to fork it and enjoy coding :)
